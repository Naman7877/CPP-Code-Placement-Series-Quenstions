in a subset there are two case 
- first take element of array 
- second is that not take 
their is choise so use both case in recursive 


 void solve(vector<int> nums,int index,vector<int>out , vector<vector<int>>& ans)
    {
    
    // if index cross the size of vector than add that output vector in ans vector
        if(index>=nums.size())
        {
            ans.push_back(out);
            return ;
        }
        
        // this call is for exclude mean here element is not selected
        solve(nums,index+1,out,ans);
        
        
        // here elemen is selected
        // include case
        int element=nums[index];
        out.push_back(element);
        solve(nums,index+1,out,ans);
        
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> out;
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        solve(nums,0,out,ans);
        
        return ans;
        
    }
